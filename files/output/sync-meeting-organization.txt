Hey team,

Just a heads-up that Thursday's sync with Alex has been moved to Friday at 10:30 AM due to a conflict with the product review. Please update your calendars. We’ll still be covering the roadmap adjustments and Q3 feature prioritization, so bring your notes from last week.

Let me know if this causes any issues. Recording will be shared for anyone who can't make it.

Thanks,
Jordan
