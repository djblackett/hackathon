Hi Jenna,

Please find attached the April 2025 invoice for the Woodbridge account. It includes three line items: the final development sprint, post-launch support hours, and the annual hosting renewal. The total comes to $8,450. Payment is due by May 15th.

Let me know if you need a breakdown by task or hours. Happy to send that over.

Best,
David
