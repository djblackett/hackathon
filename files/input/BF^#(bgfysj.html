    <h1>Photosynthesis: Turning Light into Life</h1>
    <p>
      Photosynthesis is the fundamental process by which green plants, algae,
      and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. Using
      chlorophyll pigments, these organisms capture sunlight and transform
      carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This not only fuels
      their growth but also releases the oxygen we breathe.

    <h2>Key Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Light Reactions</strong>: Sunlight is absorbed, splitting water
        molecules and generating ATP and NADPH.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Calvin Cycle</strong>: ATP and NADPH drive the conversion of
        CO<sub>2</sub> into glucose.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Photosynthesis underpins most food webs and regulates atmospheric
      CO<sub>2</sub>. Understanding it is crucial for agriculture, climate
      science, and renewable energy research.
