Hey!
Just wanted to check in — I was thinking about you earlier today for some reason. I think it's 'cause I passed that little café we went to last spring, the one with the weird plant wall and the cinnamon rolls that were, like, offensively good? Anyway, made me laugh.

How's your week going? Things here have been a bit of a blur — work's been nonstop, and I finally finished that project I was ranting about. You would've been proud of the amount of coffee it took.

Also, random: I saw a dog today that looked exactly like yours, but somehow even more dramatic. It barked at a leaf and then looked genuinely offended when it moved.

Anyway, no pressure to reply fast or anything — just wanted to say hey and that I hope everything's going okay on your end. Talk soon?
